Customer Churn Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes why customers leave a telecom company using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The goal is to identify which customer attributes, behaviors, and service patterns contribute to higher churn and provide actionable recommendations for retention.
The analysis is based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset and includes detailed examination of contract type, payment method, tenure, service usage, and demographics.

Project Objective

To identify the key drivers of customer churn and generate business insights that can help reduce the churn rate through better customer targeting, engagement, and contract strategy.
Key Insights

1. Contract Type — Most Powerful Predictor
Customers with flexible short-term plans churn the most.
Month-to-month: 42% churn
One-year: 11% churn
Two-year: 3% churn
These numbers clearly show: long-term contracts dramatically reduce customer churn.

2. Payment Method — Strong Indicator of Instability
Customers paying via electronic checks churn far more than others.
Electronic check: 45% churn
Credit card / bank transfer: ~15–18% churn
Electronic check users are more unstable and prone to leave.

3. Tenure — Early-stage customers are at highest risk
Churn decreases as customers stay longer.
< 1 year: 50% churn
1–3 years: ~35%
> 3 years: 15%
This shows churn is mainly an early-stage problem.

4. Internet Service Type
Fiber optic customers: 30% churn
DSL customers: 20% churn
Fiber users expect high performance; dissatisfaction pushes them to churn faster.

5. Senior Citizens
Senior citizens: 41% churn
Non-seniors: 26% churn
Senior customers need clearer communication, easier billing, and more support.

Visual Insights
Your visualizations (bar charts, churn distribution plots, tenure vs churn curves) reveal:
Electronic check users churn almost 3× more than card users.
Month-to-month customers show high volatility.
Churn rate drops sharply as tenure increases.

All visual evidence aligns consistently with the statistical findings.

Actionable Recommendations
1. Push Long-Term Contracts

Offer discounts or exclusive benefits for 1–2 year plans.

2. Reduce Electronic Check Usage

Nudge customers toward credit card or auto-debit options.

3. Strengthen First-Year Engagement

Customer onboarding, retention messaging, and personalized offers should target first-year users.

4. Improve Support for Senior Citizens

Simplify billing, improve communication, and build dedicated support.

All recommendations are backed by the dataset analysis.
